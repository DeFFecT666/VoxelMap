## VoxelMap 1.12.2
### VoxelMap is a minimap and worldmap mod that makes a great effort to be accurate to the colors you see in the world (and your resource pack).   Display your surroundings, or view the entire (explored) world.

### It has useful functionality like per-dimension waypoints, mob icons, teleport to waypoint (if the player has permission), and nether mapping.  Optional chunk grid and biome overlay (with biome labels in full screen mode)
